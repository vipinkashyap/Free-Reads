# free_reads

An app that lets users browse books reviewed by the New York Times along with links to download the books from Libgen

## How this was done

- Information is sourced using the [NYTimes books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview) and download links come from [Libgen](https://libgen.is/)
- A books bloc is the brain of the flutter app (dependency: flutter_bloc)
- The intent is to have users browse curated books and buy or download if interested
